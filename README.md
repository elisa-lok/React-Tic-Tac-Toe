Features:

Two-player gameplay with customizable player names.
Players take turns marking the board with 'X' or 'O' symbols.
The game detects and displays a winner when three consecutive symbols (X or O) appear in a row, column, or diagonal.
A "Rematch" button allows players to start a new game with a fresh board.
